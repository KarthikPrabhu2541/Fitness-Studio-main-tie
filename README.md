- It might show dangerous due to being tagged as such due to some links but rest assured there are no threats.
- It can be visited by clicking on details and then visit unsafe site.
- DO Not Refresh as 404.html hasnt been added yet to configure the refresh back to same page and not to 404 error page.

# Instructions to Run the react web application


### 1. Clone the current Github Repository into local System

### 2. Use a suitable IDE like VSCode or the command prompt 

### 3. Using npm, download the node modules using the command
     ### `npm i react-scripts`

### 4. You can Run the React Application on localhost using the following command 
     ### `npm start`

#### To enable payments , go to src/components/enrolnow/pages/discount.jsx, remove the comment on the onclick command line and paste your razorpay account link for the popup after clicking on payments.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
